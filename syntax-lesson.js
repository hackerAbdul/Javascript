//Todays lesson we will cover syntax structure for Javascript


/* In order for us to understand javascript language
it is essential for us to understand how to write comments */


//So in the syntax lesson 1 we have covered a range of synstax from comments to printing variables

//lets make a string variable 

var string = "This is a string";

//lets make a number variable

var integer = 1;

//lets create a variable and re-initialise that variable

let dreamCar = "Mercedes";

console.log(dreamCar);

dreamCar = "Audi";

console.log(dreamCar);

//make a constant variable

const Name = "abdulkadir"

console.log(Name);

//Print off a boolean

console.log(true);

//Create an undefine variable and print it off

var nothing;

console.log(nothing);

//Create a null variable and print it off

var empty = null;

console.log(empty);
